**K**inship (genetic relatedness) using **G**BS (genotyping-by-sequencing) with **D**epth adjustment

R code for the analysis of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data, primarily to construct a genomic relationship matrix for the genotyped individuals. The code can be used on its own, or incorporated into other R programs. There are QC tools (primarily graphical output), relationship estimation tools, pedigree verification tools and pedigree ‘mix and match’ tools. The latter two operations require additional input information about the samples genotyped.

The manual describing the use of the code is **KGDManual.pdf** in the top directory of this repository.

This project was supported by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment via its funding of the “Genomics for Production & Security in a Biological Economy” programme (Contract ID C10X1306). Additional outputs from that project can be found on its [ResearchGate page](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Genotyping-for-production-and-security-in-a-biological-economy-an-MBIE-project).
